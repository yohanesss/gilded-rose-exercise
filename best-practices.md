# Best Practices used in this exercise:

1. Avoid Global Variable by using classed (to make our code predictable, and more easy to maintain)
2. Use Linter and Formatter (to prevent unnecessary any syntax error)
3. Use of Inheritance when needed. (In this exercise generic `Item` class is created and used as parent of other more specific class, Keep the code DRY)
